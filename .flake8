# The following rules come from plugins that are not used by typeshed.
# Since typeshed stubs them, they can still be expected to be found in a
# developer's venv for intellisense and reference reasons
#     A      flake8-builtins
#     D      flake8-docstrings
#     N8     pep8-naming
#     SIM    flake8-simplify
#     RST    flake8-rst-docstrings
#     TYP    flake8-typing-imports

# The following rules are incompatible with or enforced by black:
#     E203   whitespace before ':' -- scripts only
#     E301   expected 1 blank line
#     E302   expected 2 blank lines
#     E305   expected 2 blank lines
#     E501   line too long

# Some rules are considered irrelevant to stub files:
#     B      All flake8-bugbear rules are .py-specific
#     E701   multiple statements on one line (colon) -- disallows "..." on the same line
#     F401   imported but unused -- does not recognize re-exports
#            https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes/issues/474
#     F822   undefined name in __all__ -- flake8 does not recognize 'foo: Any'
#            https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes/issues/533

# Rules that are out of the control of stub authors:
#     E741   ambiguous variable name
#     F403   import *' used; unable to detect undefined names
#     F405   defined from star imports
