# error: failed to find stub
# ==========================
# These modules have been migrated to external packages
# and emit an `ImportError` if people try to use the
# functions/classes defined within
webtest.ext
webtest.sel
# Compatibility/utility modules for internal use that didn't
# seem worth including in the stubs
webtest.compat
webtest.lint
webtest.utils

# error: variable differs from runtime type
# =========================================
# Even though this can be `None`, it never should be during
# normal use of WebTest, so it seems more pragmatic to treat
# it as always non-`None`
