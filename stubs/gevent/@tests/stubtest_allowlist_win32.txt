# these shouldn't be in __all__ they end up there, due to how gevent imports

gevent.subprocess.STARTUPINFO.copy

# these get exported but don't actually work on win32 so we ignore them

# these don't exist on win32 in stdlib, but they do in gevent, for now we ignore them

# the docs say this doesn't work on windows, so it has been removed
